    Ahoy, I'm Wylie!
  </p>
  <p>I'm a dad and a partner. I love Lego, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/wyliefisher" target="_blank">books</a>, animals, and the kind of everyday creativity that shows up in gardens, campfires, board games, and building things with your hands. Our home is shared with two cats, a dog named Meatball, and a few other tiny lives, with chickens still high on the wish list.</p>
  <p>Most days, you'll find me thinking about how to create spaces that feel welcoming, thoughtful, and alive. My work centers on running and shaping a community facility built around movement, exploration, and connection. I live at the intersection of operations, creativity, and people, building systems that support others, shaping experiences that feel intentional, and helping turn big ideas into places that matter.</p>
  <p>I'm not actively programming anymore, but I still carry the heart of a front-end developer. That background in structure, clarity, and problem-solving deeply informs how I approach everything I do today, from refining processes to designing programs to thinking about growth. I care about accessibility, sustainability, and creating environments where people feel safe to try, fail, learn, and belong.</p>
  <p>At my core, I'm guided by a commitment to fairness, curiosity, generosity, and honesty. Whether I'm tending a garden bed, smoothing out a workflow, or welcoming someone through the door, I'm always trying to leave things a little better than I found them.</p>
  <p>If you're curious about what I'm building, or just want to say hello, <a href="mailto:me@wyliefisher.com">I'd love to connect</a>.</p>
