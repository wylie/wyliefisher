    Ahoy, I'm Wylie!
  </p>
  <p>I'm a dad, a partner, and a friend. I'm an avid <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/wyliefisher" target="_blank">reader</a> and a lover of Lego. I love animals and we're currently sharing our home with two cats, a dog, and five Sea Monkeys (with chickens on the wish list!). Creativity is a big part of my life, from creating art to listening to <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/wyliefisher" target="_blank">music</a>. You'll often find me outdoors: walking our dog Meatball, hiking trails, navigating rivers in my white-water kayak or on a raft, biking, or swimming in whatever body of water I can find. When home, I'm tending to my garden, playing <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/wyliefisher" target="_blank">board games</a>, goofing with my family, or enjoying some well-deserved couch time with TV, movies, or video games.</p>
  <p>I'm also a developer with a focus on the front-end. What drives me is the amazing process of bringing ideas to digital lifeâ€”there's nothing quite like seeing your work materialize in the browser, knowing you've crafted something both functional and beautiful.</p>
  <p>At my core, I'm guided by values that shape everything I do: a commitment to social justice, a deep care for our earth, an endless curiosity about the world, genuine generosity, and unwavering honesty. These principles inform how I collaborate, create, and grow, both personally and professionally.</p>
