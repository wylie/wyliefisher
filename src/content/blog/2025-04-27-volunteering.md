We've been looking for a place to volunteer our time, but something always comes up and seems to take up our time. A couple months ago I found a place where we could volunteer our time, and fit with our interests. Amazing! So I signed the three of us up and yesterday the whole family went and volunteered with the Pisgah Conservancy. 

We met at the Ranger Station in Pisgah National Forest and broke apart into groups based on what we were going to help with. We had signed up for Gardening, Invasive Plant Removal, and one other thing that I can not remember right now. We ended up doing the gardening, which was fun, even though it was geared mostly towards kiddos. Which makes sense, we had one in tow. We did a lot of weeding and clearing. We put down a lot of mulch, and we planted some Cinnamon Ferns right infront of the Pisgah Forest sign, so they will be easy to see grow in the future.

It ended at the Oskar Blues brewery where we got a free drink and a free burger. So we hung out for a while and enjoyed the food while we rested up. It was a lovely day!
