This week marked six months since I was laid off. Half a year of job searching, refining my resume, and trying to land the next opportunity. And this week, I got exactly what I needed—a "swift kick in the pants" from an old friend via a LinkedIn chat.

I've been applying to jobs, tweaking my resume, updating my site here and there. But their message made something clear: I wasn't doing enough. Not nearly enough. A job search isn't just about checking boxes-it's about being deliberate, consistent, and proactive every single day.

They didn't just tell me to work harder; they gave me a roadmap. Here's what I need to focus on:

### Website & Portfolio

- Make my **GitHub** link more prominent.
- **Showcase** more **professional work** on my website.
- **Fix or remove** any **placeholder images** on sites I maintain.
- Ensure my **resume** is easily accessible in **PDF**, **HTML**, and **Word** formats.
- Treat my website as a **portfolio**, not an afterthought-iterate and improve constantly.

Skills & Learning

- Position myself as a **full-stack developer**-even if front-end is my strength.
- Regularly update my **blog/profile** with coursework and skill progress.
- Focus on **Node**, **Web APIs**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, **AI** instead of lower-level courses.
- Remove **“Learn Intermediate CC Course”** and similar low-value coursework.

### Job Application Strategy

- Ensure **LinkedIn** matches my **resume** exactly for **ATS** compatibility.
- Track applications in a **spreadsheet** (date, company, position, job link).
- Apply to **at least 2 jobs** per day.
- Use **resume evaluation tools** (like Jobscan) or get professional feedback.
- **Optimize** my resume for **Applicant Tracking Systems** (ATS) and upload it to **Indeed**.

### Interview Preparation

- **Do not** use a **laptop camera** for virtual interviews.
- Use **over-ear**, **wired headphones with a mic** instead of built-in audio.
- **Blur my background** to keep the focus professional.

Was all of this easy to hear? No. But was it good to hear? Absolutely. Sometimes, we need that "swift kick in the pants" to remind us that effort alone isn't enough-it's about focus, discipline, and showing up every single day.

I've got a new plan, now it's time to get to work.
