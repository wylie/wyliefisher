Well, it's quite the weathery Winter here in WNC! Last week we got hit with ice, now snow. It snowed all day yesterday and a little into this morning. Sadly it was not good for sledding, but it was good for romping around in and having snowball fights. My only complaint is that we only had one day of school last week, and with this snow I imagine we will have some more days off. But I also do get to hang out with my son more, so that's a bonus.

I made a big work change today that definitely goint to affect my life as well. I quit my current position as General Manager. It was a tough decision, and not one I could make alone. I really enjoy the position, and the people I get to work with. The thing leading me to quit was a lack of authority and autonimity from other members of leadership. It didn't really feel like a General Manager role, it felt more like an Assistant role.

Oh well, a new year and time for a new position. Know anybody hiring?
