This week I’ve been helping my dad tear down sheetrock, studs, flooring, and whatever else needs to go as he and my mom remodel their kitchen. It’s been a full-on demolition job, and I love it.

Most of my work is spent in front of a screen—coding, problem-solving, tweaking layouts, and making sure everything functions just right. But there’s something deeply satisfying about stepping away from all that and getting my hands dirty with physical labor. Tearing things down, hauling materials, and seeing immediate, tangible progress is a welcome contrast to the digital world, where progress isn’t always so obvious.

Beyond the work itself, I enjoy the feeling of being physically tired. There’s a different kind of exhaustion that comes from swinging a hammer, pulling out nails, and lifting heavy materials—one that makes a good meal taste even better and a night’s sleep feel deeper and more earned. It’s the kind of tired that settles into your muscles, not just your mind, and leaves you with the sense that you’ve truly done something.

Of course, the best part is getting to help my parents. Home renovation is no small task, and being able to contribute makes me feel useful in a way that goes beyond my usual skill set. Plus, there’s something rewarding about working alongside family—whether it’s sharing stories, planning the next steps, or just standing back together and admiring the progress.

In a way, this kind of work reminds me why I like building things in the first place. Whether it’s code or construction, it’s all about creating, problem-solving, and improving something bit by bit. And every now and then, stepping away from the keyboard and picking up a crowbar instead is exactly what I need.
