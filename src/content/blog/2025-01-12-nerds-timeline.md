For years, finding a **complete and organized Star Wars timeline** has been a challenge. Official sources often provide fragmented lists, and fan efforts are sometimes incomplete or inconsistent. That's why I'm building **[NerdsTimeline.com](https://nerdstimeline.com)**â€”a one-stop resource for every piece of Star Wars canon content, laid out in a clear and structured timeline.  

### What is NerdsTimeline.com?  

NerdsTimeline.com will be a **comprehensive Star Wars canon timeline** that includes:  

- **Movies** - Every theatrical release, from *The Phantom Menace* to *The Rise of Skywalker*.  
- **TV Shows** - Animated and live-action series, from *The Clone Wars* to *Ahsoka*.  
- **Books** - Novels and young adult stories that are officially part of the canon.  
- **Comics** - Marvel and Dark Horse releases that expand the Star Wars universe.  
- **Video Games** - Canon games that contribute to the larger Star Wars story.  

Instead of jumping between wikis and forums, **everything will be in one place, ordered chronologically, or by release date** and easily searchable.  

### Why Build This?  

I've always loved Star Wars since I was a little kid. I even belonged to the Official Star Wars Fan Club and still have my issues of Bantha Tracks. Unfortunately trying to figure out where a book or show fits into the larger story can be frustrating. I wanted a **clean, user-friendly timeline** that allows fans to:  

- **See how different stories connect** within the Star Wars universe.  
- **Discover new content** they may have missed.  
- **Easily track releases** and chronological placements.  

### Features (Planned and In Progress)  

**Full Timeline Navigation** - Browse by era, or medium.  
**Detailed Entries** - Each entry will have descriptions, release dates, and links.  
**Filtering** - Quickly find specific books, movies, or games.  

### What's Next?  

I'm actively building out the database and fine-tuning the site's design. The goal is to create **a smooth, intuitive experience** for both casual fans and hardcore Star Wars lore enthusiasts.  

If you're interested, check out **[NerdsTimeline.com](https://nerdstimeline.com)**, or check out the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/wylie/starwars) and follow along as the project grows!  

May the Force be with you!
