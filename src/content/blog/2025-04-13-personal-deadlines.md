You know how sometimes you make lists for yourself? And along with those lists you add due dates? Well, I've been doing a lot of that lately, except I've been missing the deadline dates.

I think it goes back to my post from last week about schedules. I'm still trying to figure out my schedule so it's making it difficult to stick to my due dates for those items on my lists.

One of the big problems I have with missing my own deadlines is that it just makes me feel like I'm failing. Which is odd, because these are self-imposed deadlines, so I can easily move them without consequence. Do I move these things? Nope, I just watch the due date come and go and I feel bad for missing them.

Perhaps I should try to learn something from this and maybe not make so many self-imposed deadlines?
