I've recently had to change my schedule, and it's been more of a mental and emotional adjustment than I expected. Balancing the needs of work, family, school, and everything else life throws at us isn’t just a matter of logistics—it’s a full-on juggling act that constantly shifts with no warning.

When one part of the schedule changes, the ripple effect can be intense. A new work meeting time might mean adjusting drop-off for school, which in turn pushes lunch later or forces a reschedule of an appointment. It feels like building a house of cards that constantly needs reinforcement.

What makes it especially tricky is how intertwined everything is. My schedule doesn’t just affect me—it affects everyone around me. Coordinating with my partner, making sure the kiddo gets to school and extracurriculars on time, and still finding space to walk the dog or prep a halfway decent dinner can feel like solving a puzzle that keeps changing shape.

And yet, somehow, we keep adapting. There’s something weirdly beautiful about how we stretch and reconfigure to make it all work. It's not always elegant. Sometimes it's duct tape and late-night emails. But there's also a quiet resilience in it—a shared determination to keep showing up for each other, even when the rhythm changes.

If you’re in the middle of schedule chaos too, I see you. It’s hard, and it’s okay to admit that. But we’re doing it. One adjustment at a time.
