This post title could have secondary meanings at this time in America, but I'm talking about frozen water ice.

We got hit with a huge storm that swept through the South East and up into New England. It closed school for four days, which made sense. The roads were pretty bad and there isn't the infrastructure here to deal with snow let alone ice. I think I saw a snow plow come through once and I never saw anybody with sand or salt come through. The nice thing about this whole escapade was that it was relatively sunny during the day so ice could melt where the sun could hit. At night though it would all freeze again so the morning commute was sketchy. 

We also lost power during the tail-end of the storm. It was out for about 23 hours, which was long enough. It started to get very cold in our house towards the end.

Then on Thursday the disconnect box for our furnace melted because of some faulty wiring. Thankfully we still had electricity so we could run a space heater.
