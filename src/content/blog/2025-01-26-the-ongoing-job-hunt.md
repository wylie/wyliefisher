Lately, applying for jobs has felt like a full-time job in itself. Almost every day, I find myself **scanning job boards, updating applications, and tracking responses** (which, more often than not, are rejections).  

I've been documenting my efforts, and when I look back at my notes, **job hunting is the most common thread**. It's become part of my daily routine:  

- Searching for new job postings.  
- Tweaking my resume and cover letter.  
- Submitting applications.  
- Checking email for replies (and bracing for the inevitable "we've decided to move forward with other candidates").  
- Tracking how many applications I've sent, how many responses I've received, and how many times I've been told "no."  

### The Numbers So Far  

At this point, my stats look something like this:  

- **Applied to:** 70+ jobs  
- **Interviews:** 0  
- **Rejections:** 15+  

Seeing those numbers laid out is a bit brutal, but it also reminds me that I'm putting in the work.  

### The Emotional Rollercoaster  

The job search isn't just about sending applications—it's also about **managing expectations**. Some days I feel **optimistic**, thinking, "This is the one that's going to work out". Other days, it's just **exhausting**, and I have to fight the urge to take a break from it altogether.  

Rejections don't sting as much as they used to, but **the silence is harder**—sending out dozens of applications and hearing nothing back can be frustrating.  

### Keeping Momentum  

Despite everything, I'm staying **consistent**. I remind myself that every rejection means I'm one step closer to the right opportunity. And in the meantime, I'm:  

- **Working on personal projects** like *NerdsTimeline.com* and *HowDoYouFeelTo.day*.  
- **Sharpening my skills** by coding, reading up on industry trends, and exploring new tools.  
- **Taking breaks when I need to** because job searching **shouldn't** be an all-consuming black hole of stress.  

### Moving Forward  

The job search is ongoing, and I don't know when it will end. But I do know that **I'm showing up, doing the work, and putting myself out there.** That's all I can do.  

For now, I'll keep applying, keep tracking, and **hope that one of these applications finally turns into a yes.**
