You know how at the end of the year you get a bunch of emails from services you belong to, telling you how much you used their service?

I get this information from PlayStation, Goodreads, Apple, and Twitch. I’ve also been keeping track of a couple of other real-life metrics, which I find just as interesting. Looking at the numbers gives me a tangible way to reflect on how I spent my time over the past year.

Here are the metrics I got from 2024:

### Fitness and Health

- **Workout Miles Walked**: Walking 581.26 miles is quite an achievement! I'm amazed that I logged this many miles, even with everything that happened in 2024. *These are only miles that I started a walking workout on my watch, this does not include just regular walking*
- **Workout Elevation Feet Climbed**: Climbing 47,079 feet is equivalent to climbing Mount Everest more than one and a half times!

### Mindfulness

- **Mindfulness Minutes**: Spending 2,853 minutes on mindfulness practices has greatly improved my mental well-being and stress management. The tricky thing about this metric is that we do a meditation at the end of bedtime with my kiddo, so these are also added in here. I do try to do at least 10 minutes of meditation a day on my own.

### Reading

- **Books Read**: Reading 102 books in a year a lot. The previous year I did not read quite so many, but one year I read 110, so this is not the most that I've read. For 2025 I'm going to try for 110.
- **Pages Read**: With 28,564 pages read, I have immersed myself in countless stories and gained a wealth of knowledge.

### Gaming

- **Video Games Played**: Playing 97 different video games provided a great source of entertainment and relaxation.
- **Hours Played Video Games**: 436 hours of gaming is a significant amount of time. Do I need to cut this number down? Maybe...
- **PS Trophies Earned**: Earning 378 trophies shows my dedication to completing challenges and achieving goals in games.

### Entertainment

- **Twitch Hours Watched**: Watching 3,563 hours of Twitch streams says that perhaps I need to shut it off a little bit. I do often have some streamer going in the background, muted, while I work on things.

### Environmental Impact

We don’t have trash service or yard waste pickup at our house, so managing waste takes a bit more effort.

- **Transfer Station Pounds**: I hauled 2,700 pounds of waste to the transfer station this year. Since we don’t have yard waste pickup, I bring things like grass clippings and branches there, which costs money. This year I'm going to build a three-bin componst system in the back yard, and that should cut down on the amount we have to haul away.
- **Transfer Station Cost**: I spent $107.01 on disposing of yard waste and other materials at the transfer station, which isn't too bad.

Overall, these metrics provide a comprehensive overview of my activities and accomplishments over the past year. They serve as a reminder of the importance of balancing different aspects of life, from physical health and mental well-being to hobbies and environmental responsibility.

This year, I'm planning to track even more so I can gain deeper insights into my habits and activities. By expanding the scope of my tracking, I hope to identify new areas for improvement and continue to grow in various aspects of my life.
