It's never a great feeling. You check your inbox, see the email, and even before opening it, you know what it says.

"After careful consideration, we've decided to move forward with other candidates..."

A rejection. Another one.

You take a deep breath and archive the email because there's never anything else to read in them. But this is just part of the process. It doesn't mean you weren't good enough. It doesn't mean you weren't qualified. It just means, for whatever reason—timing, fit, internal priorities, or something else—this wasn't the right opportunity.

### It Still Stings

Even when you expect it, rejection never feels great. You spend time researching the company, customizing your resume, writing a cover letter, and imagining what it would be like to work there. Getting that email makes it feel like all that effort led to a dead end.

But try to reframe it: it wasn't a waste. Every application, every interview, every rejection is part of the process. Each one makes you sharper, helps you refine your approach, and brings you closer to the right opportunity.

### What Now?

The temptation to reply with, "Can you tell me what I did wrong?" is real. But that's not always the best way to approach it. Instead, take a moment to reflect.
	•	Did I feel truly excited about this job, or was I just hoping for any offer?
	•	What skills did this job require that I might need to work on?

If the company allows it, you might ask for feedback, but let’s be honest—these generic emails rarely suggest that any is coming

### Keep Moving Forward

Rejection is tough, but it's also information. It's a sign that you're actively trying, putting yourself out there, and making progress. The right role is out there, and every "no" gets you closer to it.

So, let yourself feel disappointed for a moment, then shake it off and get back to it. There are other applications to send, other companies to research, and eventually, one of these emails will turn into a "we'd like to interview you."

Until then, remind yourself: you're not alone in this. Every job seeker has been here. And just like them, you'll keep going.
