With my new job it's been a slow year for video games, but at the end of December I bit the bullet and purchased Arc Raiders. If you don't know, Arc Raiders is a PVP/PVE extraction shooter made by <a href="https://www.embark-studios.com">Embark Studios</a>. 

It's a slowish kind of game, but the pace suits me just fine. You also have to search for many things, collect them, and extract from the game with them. Doing that allows you to craft newer and better things to help progress your future missions. The worlds have other players in them, but also robots named Arc that you have to battle. Most of the players in the lobbies will be friendly, and they can help you with your missions thanks to proximity chat. Occasionally you get somebody who just wants to shoot everybody and doesn't care to help you. 

I've been playing this game a lot, maybe too much and maybe it's affected my sleep. It's just so fun and I want to keep going with it!

Anyways, if you haven't played it I suggest you do, or at least watch somebody play it.
