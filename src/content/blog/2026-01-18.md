We got this odd present for the holidays, a giant plant bulb coated in wax. It said we didn't have to do anything for it and it would grow and bloom and take care of itself. I don't remember what it was called on the wrapping, but the internet says it's a Amaryllis.

Every day you could see substantial growth on it, and one day you could start to see blooms wanting to break out. All with me doing nothing at all to it. Not adding water, not giving it sunlight, just leaving it on my desk in an office with no windows. Nature is pretty amazing.

If you aren't good at keeping plants I would definitely suggest getting yourself one of these and just enjoying it.
