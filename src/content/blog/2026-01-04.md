Well, 2025 was quite a year! 

At almost exactly 6 months in my job search which included: 100 jobs applied for, 0 interviews, numerous rejection letters, and even more no response, I got a job. This job wasn't one I was looking for, but it was the one I needed. I looked on the companies website and they were looking for workers. I believe I sent in my resume on Monday, interviewed on Wednesday, and had a job by Sunday. Now it's 10 months later and I've gone from lowest on the ladder to top of the ladder. I'm the General Manager of a climbing gym and bike park running the day-to-day and future of this place. 

I'm not missing web development one bit. While this job is 180º different than what I was doing I'm glad I found it. It brings new challenges, interesting work, much more human interaction, and fun to my life. I do miss being home all day, walking our dog, and feeling less stress, but I was also just not feeling much before. Now I can actively see what my actions do, and I have people who look to me for leadership. The learning curve has been steep, but welcome. I was feeling intimidated by all I needed to learn before for web development and it wasn't fun anymore.

That's the past 10 months in a nutshell. More to come!
