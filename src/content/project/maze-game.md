I love video games. A bunch. They can be fun, challenging, adventursome, sad, and moving. My dad has always thought that I should make video games, but it felt like a field that was out of my reach, until I stumbled upon [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

Pico-8 is a fantasy console where you can write Lua to create games for a 128x128 pixel screen that has 16 colors. It's a fun little app to play with and I suggest you try it out if you like video games and developing.

For my first game I thought I'd go "easy", the only problem is I don't really know what easy is when it comes to making a video game. A maze sounded pretty simple though. I could make it so I wouldn't have to worry about physics, or anything like that. Plus there's a simple start and end to a maze. Once I got the graphics and movement working I could always add things such as enemies, or loot to pick up, and even sounds. So I began to make a maze game.

It was fun making the graphics, and fun watching them come to life as I began to code things up. This is still a work in progress, but it is playable. <a href="https://wylie.github.io/pico-8/" target="_blank">Here's a link to the game</a>.
