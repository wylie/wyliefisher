I've been playing around with <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a> a lot lately, and I love it. I redid this website in it, wrote a [blog post](/blog/2025-03-09-astro/) about it, and I thought that it was time to make a "real" project with it. I don't know if I consider my portfolio site to be a "real" project...

Anyways, you can read my thoughts on Astro at the [blog post](/blog/2025-03-09-astro/), but the TL;DR is that I love it. It feels intuitive, easy to learn, and flexible.

<a href="https://wylie.github.io/teresafisherphd/" target="_blank">Milkweed Mental Health</a> will be the site for my wife's psychology private practice. She's been working with an <a href="https://www.christymichellestudio.com/" target="_blank">illustrator friend</a> for all the graphics, and I used those to generate a color pallete. We've been working together on the pages, photographs, and layoutâ€”she's been working on the copy.

It's been a really fun experience to build something for my wife, and to build it in Astro. Eventually we will hook up a domain name to it and officially launch it, but for now you can find the <a href="https://wylie.github.io/teresafisherphd/" target="_blank">site here</a>
