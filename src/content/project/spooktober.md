This is a very small <a href="https://github.com/wylie/spooktober" target="_blank">repo</a> that I created for a contest on Codecademy.

The objective was to create a Halloween themed something.

I was coming late to the competition so I decided to write a simple script in python. Basically taking the age-old question of "Trick or Treat?" and asking the user. It's so small in fact that I may as well paste it here!

````python
import random
while True:
    t_or_t = input("🎃 Trick or Treat? ").lower()
    if t_or_t == "trick":
        print("👻 B", end="")
        print("".join(random.choice(["O", "o"]) for _ in range(100)))
        break
    elif t_or_t == "treat":
        print("🍫 Happy Halloween! Have some candy 🍫")
        break
    else:
        print("💀 Hey, that's not an option!")
        continue
