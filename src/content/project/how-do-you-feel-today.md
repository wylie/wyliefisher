This is a project that I started a long time ago and I wish I could remember the reasons why I wanted to start it. I know that I did like the idea of people creating a kind of mosaic of their emotions.

This most recent iteration of the site uses the same data from way back in 2013, but it was created in React with Create React App (R.I.P.). I'm also pulling the data from [jsonbin.io](https://jsonbin.io), which was a first for me, using jsonbin.io I mean.

I've never really broadcast that this site is out there, which to me explains why the mosaic is as small as it is, but that's okay. It doesn't need to be a huge repository of feelings for me to be happy of it.

If you want to add your own feeling, <a href="https://howdoyoufeelto.day/" target="_blank">please go right ahead</a>!
