Maybe a dozen years ago I started, for some reason, to say "SANTA COMMANDS IT!" around the holidays when people would ask for things, no matter what it was. This kept on for a couple years because I found it funny, though I don't know if others do...

I then made a backstory for this oddness. Why is Santa demanding something? Why is his voice booming? Well, Santa has been doing his thing for a long time and I felt like he might have gotten a little tired of people asking him for stuff, plus he definitely got a little power hungry.

Then I realized that this idea could be turned into a website!

If you <a href="https://wylie.github.io/SantaCommandsIt/" target="_blank">visit the site</a> you can see that it is definitely still a work in progress. I usually get the bug to work on this around the winter holidays when things are already chaotic. If you feel the desire to help out on <a href="https://github.com/wylie/SantaCommandsIt" target="_blank">this repo</a>, please go ahead!
