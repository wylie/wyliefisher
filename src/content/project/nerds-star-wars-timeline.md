Yes, I like Star Wars. I have since I was very little and I joined the Official Star Wars Lucasfilm Fan Club. I recieved the newsletter in the mail, it was called Bantha Tracks, and I still have them. They live in an official Star Wars Fan Club folder which also contains my Fan Club membership card, including my "Force Number", some patches from movies, some photos, and a reply to a letter I sent in asking how the light sabers worked.

I was super excited when the original trilogy was rereleased into theaters. I was excited when the prequels came out. I was even excited when the latest trilogy came out. Now we have TV Shows, video games, books, and comic books. I never read any Star Wars books when I was little, but I did get into them after Disney purchased Star Wars and made certain things canon, and other things legends. I don't know why I never read them when I was little, maybe I was just at the wrong age. I do know that my brother read a lot of them.

Anyways, now that I am watching movies, TV shows, reading the books, playing the video games, and reading some of the comic books, I sometimes want to know where in the timeline this one piece of media lands. If yo are a Star Wars nerd you might know that there are plenty of timelines out there. What I felt was lacking was a unified timeline where you could see where this book fell in relation to a video game. I didn't sant to try and suss that out myself by combing through multiple timelines. So the **Nerds Timeline** was born!

This is definitely still a work in progress. Mostly I am continuing to add new bits of media, mostly books and comic books, to the site. Then I want to go back in and add a search feature and perhaps more filter options.
